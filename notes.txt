Worldgen simulation is accomplished by extracting relative classes from the Minecraft JAR. Classes are found using a ClassTranslator.
For MC 1.16-1.17, the ClassTranslator is created by amidst.mojangapi.minecraftinterface.local.DefaultClassTranslator.
(Older versions have their own ClassTranslator creators)

Note that worldgen has been datapack driven since MC 1.16, which is supported. Presumably, this means AMIDST can already handle datapacks, or at least the default ones.
